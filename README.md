### ‚ùìWhat is this?

The purpose of this repository is to provide a place for GitHub & the {CUSTOMER-NAME} Community to communicate and collaborate on all the GitHub things -- including:

- {CUSTOMER-NAME}'s digital transformation
- Questions and answers
- Community meeting ideas and planning
- Meeting minutes and notes
- Feedback and features requests

### ü§î Why use this?

Note that GitHub relies heavily on Markdown, a lightweight markup language designed to allow you to create expressive, styled documents quickly and easily.  If you're not familiar with Markdown, consider bookmarking a good 'cheat sheet'.  Here's one we [like](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Use this repository to communicate and collaborate [asynchronously](https://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/#1-prefer-asynchronous-communication) -- so that any question asked and any answer provided may be easily shared and reused.

The use of this repository draws upon ideas from:

- [Why everything should have a URL](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/)

- [15 rules for communicating at GitHub](https://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/)
